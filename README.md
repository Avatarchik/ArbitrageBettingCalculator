# Arbitrage Betting Calculator

(In Progress)

This project aims to create a piece of software that identifies arbitrage betting opportunities.

Arbitrage betting is a way to bet in which there is (in theory) no risk of loss.

This is possible by betting on all possible outcomes, granted that certain conditions are met.

This calculator checks for these conditions in a two-outcome scenario.
